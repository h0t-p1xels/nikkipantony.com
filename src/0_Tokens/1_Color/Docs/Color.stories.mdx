## Action Color Tokens

specific purpose. For example, Green has a positive connotation so it is commonly used as an action color

<section id="gradients" style={{ marginTop: "60px" }}>

## Gradient Tokens

These are [example] color gradients. Gradients can be used within user interfaces when being built with design
systems to give more creative freedom to designers. While flat colors brings consistency it can also sometimes
stifle a design's potential, gradients can open the door to infinite possibilities. Through blending brand colors,
designers can create eye-catching and more memorable visual designs and brand identities.

<section id="opacities" style={{ marginTop: "60px" }}>

## Opacity Tokens

These are [example] opacity values. In design opacity refers to how transparent an object is. Objects with lower
opacity allow more light to pass through them, therefore becoming more see-through. The more solid an object is,
the less light that can pass through it which translates to a higher opacity.

## Shade Function Tokens

These are [example] shade function values. Color shades are based on the percentage of black within a color. It is
a good idea to scale color shade names in a design systems for simplicity and it's also a good ideas to offer just
a limited number of shade options to further help with consistency, avoid endless decision making and assist with
accessibility compliance. All full color palette complete with shade versions can be found in the style guide.
