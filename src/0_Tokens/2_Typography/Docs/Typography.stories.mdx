# Typography Design Tokens

Typography is an important part of a design system that brings consistency across experiences and platforms.
Good typography rules help present content clearly and efficiently as well as convey the overall brands style
and tone. On this page you will find [example] typography design tokens to be used within the [ally] design
system. Extra rules, best practices and examples of how typography tokens should and should not be used within
compoents can be found in the style guide which should be updated as the desgin system develops to aid
designers/developers making future design decions within the system. An extensive list of example typography
only use cases can also be found in the Typography section of the design system.

## Typeface Tokens

These are [example] typeface tokens. A typeface is a set of characters of the same design.
These characters include letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and symbols.

<section id="sizes" style={{ marginTop: "60px" }}>

## Font Size Tokens

These are [example] font size tokens. All font sizes in this design system have a ratio of 1.250
which is known as the Major Third type scale. This means that each size is multiplied or divided
by 1.250 from the previous size, starting with the base size (1rem / 16px), and rounded. Any
component using typography should use a font size from this list.

<FontSizes />

<section id="weights" style={{ marginTop: "60px" }}>

## Font Weight Tokens

These are [example] font weight tokens. Typeface families come with a range of possible font weights
(thinness / boldness). These typically have a scale from 100 (the thinist) through to 700 (bold) and
then to 900 (known as black which is the boldist). By specifying specific font weights to be used within
the [ally] design system we help simplify the typography of the system and help create better uniformity
throughout the UI as a whole.

<section id="leading" style={{ marginTop: "60px" }}>

## Leading Tokens

These are [example] leading tokesn. In typography, leading is the space between adjacent lines of type.
In web development this is known as `line-height` and it can be set using many different value types.
In the [ally] design system we use unit-less values where the number given is multiplied by the element's
font size for flexability with their use.

<section id="tracking" style={{ marginTop: "60px" }}>

## Tracking Tokens

These are [example] tracking tokens. Tracking in typography is the horizontal spacing between type characters
which is set using the `letter-spacing` CSS property in web development. Positive values of `letter-spacing`
cause characters to spread farther apart, while negative values bring characters closer together. In the [ally]
design system we set the tracking value using the `em` unit as this is relative to the font size of the text
(e.g 2em means 2 times the size of the current font).
