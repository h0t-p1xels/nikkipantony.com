# Grid

This file is a documentation-only MDX file, i.e. it doesn't contain any `<Story>` definitions.

Therefore, it shows up in the [navigation](https://github.com/) UI as a document icon.

It can, however, still contain a `<Canvas>` definition:

<Canvas>
  <div>
    <h3>This is a preview block within a documentation-only MDX file</h3>
    <p>
      You may need to wrap certain documentation in a `Preview` in order to reset the styles for use
      cases such as documenting a design system.
    </p>
  </div>
</Canvas>
