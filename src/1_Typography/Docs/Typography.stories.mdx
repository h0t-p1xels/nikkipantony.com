# Typography Guidelines

These guidelines visually present the formatting decisions made
using this design system's typography design tokens. This guide shows
examples of the correct use of HTML5 semantic markup to be used as well
as styling for consistency to create a higher level of accessibility for
products built with this system. It should also be noted that no classes
are applied to elements to render this styling, the styling
is applied directly to the elements to maintain consistency. In
circumstances when a class is needed, a component should be built instead
using the BEM naming convention.

<div id="Headings" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Headings

Headings are typography components used to create hierarchies
within text. The `<h1>` to `<h6>` elements are used to represent
the six levels of section and/or page headings with `<h1>` being at
the highest hierarchical level and `<h6>` being the lowest. You
should only use one `<h1>` per page. However, using more than one
will not result in an error, but using only one is seen as best
practice. Having a single top-level title is also arguably better
for screenreader users, and for SEO.

### Coded Example

<Canvas className="ally-headings" style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
    <h1>H1 Heading</h1>
    <h2>H2 Heading</h2>
    <h3>H3 Heading</h3>
    <h4>H4 Heading</h4>
    <h5>H5 Heading</h5>
    <h6>H6 Heading</h6>
  </div>
</Canvas>

<div id="Paragraphs" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are represented in visual media as blocks of text
structured to group related text content and separate them from
adjacent blocks using white space (blank lines). The `<p>` element
is used to create paragraph components.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>This is a paragraph body text example.</p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Links" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Links

Links allow users to navigate to a different location. They can
be presented inline inside a paragraph or as standalone text.
The `<a>` element along with its `<href>` attribute are used
to create hyperlink components know as an anchor link which can
lead to web pages, files, email addresses, locations, phone number,
etc. in the same page, or anywhere else a URL can address.
Content within each `<a>` element should indicate the link's
destination. Underline should only be used for text links
and should never be used as a mechanism for adding emphasis.
While using this design system you should use the `<ExLink>`
atom component for external links, the `<NavLink>` component
for navigation, and the `<SkipLink>` to skip to main content to
help improve accessibility.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    This is an <a href="#">anchor link</a> example.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Microcopy" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Microcopy

Microcopy should be used to represent side comments and
small print, such as copyright and legal text. The `<small>`
element should be used instead of simply applying a smaller
font size through styling for its semantic meaning.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    <small>Microcopy text example.</small>
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Emphasis" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Emphasis

Emphasis in typography is the strengthening of words in text
with the font of those words in a different style from the
rest to convey stressed emphasis. The `<em>` element is used
to highlight emphasis and can affect the meaning of the
sentence itself.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    This is an example of <em>emphasis</em> in text copy.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Idiomatic" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Idiomatic Text

Idiomatic text is a range of text with different semantic
meaning than the surrounding text such as for technical terms,
taxonomical designations, thoughts or words from another
language (which should include the `<lang>` attribute to
identify the language). The `<i>` element should be used to
represent this text to help convey meaning when using this
system.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    Examples of <i>idiomatic text</i> could include...
    <br /> "She wondered, <i>What is this writer talking about, anyway?</i>"
    <br /> or <br /> "The Latin phrase <i lang="la">Veni, vidi, vici</i> is
    often mentioned in music, art, and literature."
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Strong" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Strong Importance

The `<strong>` element indicates that its contents has a
strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    An example of a sentence that could use the <strong>strong</strong> element
    is... <br /> "before proceeding,
    <strong> make sure you put on your safety goggles</strong>."
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Attention" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Bring Attention

To draw the reader's attention to text content, which is not otherwise granted
special importance, the `<b>` element should be used which gives the text a heavier
weight than the standard paragraph styling. You can use this styling for cases
such as for keywords in a summary or product names in a review.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    The two most popular science courses offered by the school are{" "}
    <b>chemistry</b> (the study of chemicals and the composition of substances)
    and <b>physics</b> (the study of the nature and properties of matter and
    energy).
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Highlighting" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Highlighting

Highlight formatting is used for reference or notation purposes.
The `<mark>` element is used to represent text which is marked or highlighted.
The presence of the `<mark>` element is not announced by most
screen reading technology in its default configuration, therefore, for accessibility
it should be announced using a span with the `.sr-only` class.
This span should be placed at both the start and end of the highlighted text as
in the example shown below so that the text is not shown visually
but is still made readable to screen readers.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    <mark>
      <span className="sr-only"> [highlight starts] </span> This is highlighed
      text <span className="sr-only"> [highlight ends] </span>
    </mark>
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Abb" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Abbreviation

For abbreviations the `<abbr>` element is used to represent an abbreviation
or acronym. The `<title>` attribute is then used to provide an expansion or
description for the abbreviation, so that when the user hovers over the text, the
description is shown. The `<title>` must only contain the description and nothing else.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    You can use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to style your{" "}
    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Def" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Definitions

When showing definitions they should be styled differently to the other text.
The `<dfn>` element is used to indicate the term being defined within the
context of a definition phrase or sentence, and the `<p>` element which is the
nearest ancestor of the `<dfn>` is considered to be the definition of the term.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    The HTML Definition element `<dfn>&lt;dfn&gt;</dfn>` is used to indicate the
    term being defined.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="U" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Unarticulated Annotation

Unarticulated annotation is inline text which should be rendered in a way that
indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. The `<u>` element is used to
represent unarticulated annotation which used to be called the underline element
in older versions of HTML, and is still sometimes misused in this way. To
underline text, you should instead apply a style that includes the CSS text-decoration
property set to underline. The `<u>` element should not be used to underline
text for presentation purposes.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    You could use unarticulated annotation formatting to highlight{" "}
    <u>speling</u> mistakes.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Strike" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Strikethrough

Strikethrough text renders with a line through it to represent
things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. Strikethrough
text is created using the `<s>` element.
However, this formatting is not appropriate when indicating document
edits, for edits use the Delete / Insert formatting as below.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    This is an example of <s>strikethrough</s> text copy.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Delete" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Delete / Insert

The deleted element represents a range of text that has been deleted
from a document. This can be used when rendering track changes or source code
diff information, for example. The inserted element can be used for
the opposite purpose to indicate text that has been added to the document.
The `<del>` and `<ins>` elements should be used to create these components.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    This is an example of <del>deleted</del> and <ins>inserted</ins> text copy.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Lists" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Lists

The `<ul>` element represents an unordered list of items,
rendered as a bulleted list while the `<ol>` element
represents an ordered list of items renders as a numbered
list. Lists should either be part of a section with other
text for context or have a section heading. Lists should
not contain any other direct sibling elements other than
the `<li>` element.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <ul>
    <li>This is an unordered list example</li>
    <li>List items that are not in an order</li>
    <li>It is just a list of items</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>This is an example of an ordered list</li>
    <li>Items have a hierarchy</li>
    <li>Items are shown with a number</li>
  </ol>
</Canvas>

<div id="Time" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Time and Dates

When representing a specific period in time, the `<time>` element should be used so
that it is styled differently to stand out from the rest of the text and also
to make the data machine readable. This allows for better search engine
results and for possible custom features such as reminders. The `<time>` element
can be used to render a specific time using the 24-hour clock, a date using
the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone information), or
a time duration.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    The last meeting was on <time dateTime="2020-07-07">7 July '20</time>.
    <br />
    The next meeting starts at <time dateTime="20:00">8pm</time> on{" "}
    <time dateTime="2022-07-01">7 July '22</time> and will last{" "}
    <time dateTime="PT2H30M">2 and a half hours</time>.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Address" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Contact Details

The `<address>` element indicates that the enclosed information provides
contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.
It may include any type of contact information that is needed, such as
a physical address, URL, email address, phone number, social media handle,
geographic coordinates, and so forth. It used to be the case that
an `<address>` element was only supposed to be used to represent the contact
information of the document's author, however, its definition has since
been updated so it can now be used to mark up arbitrary addresses. When
creating contact sections you are likely to want to create a separate
component in order to use external links and also to possibly add icons
or other further styling, but the below example is still the basic typography
markup you will need to use.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <div>
    <h4>Contact me</h4>
    <address>
      <p>
        Email: <a href="mailto:me@me.com">me@me.com</a>
        <br />
        SMS: <a href="sms:+447123456789">+447123456789</a>
        <br />
        Post:{" "}
        <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xAu6oKPiDXxivzt46">
          Buckingham Palace, London, SW1A 1AA.
        </a>
      </p>
    </address>
  </div>
</Canvas>

<div id="FigureCaptions" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Figure Captions

The `<figcaption>` element represents a caption or legend
describing the rest of the content of its parent `<figure>`
element such as for an image. When using this design system
you should use the `<Figure>` atom component for this purpose,
but the below example is still the same markup you will need.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <figure>
    <img
      src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200.png/FFD700/000013?text=Figure+Placeholder"
      alt="figure placeholder with yellow background color"
    />
    <figcaption>Example figure caption.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</Canvas>

<div id="Quotation" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Inline Quotation

For inline quotation within a paragraph the `<q>` element should be
used to indicate that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation.
Most modern web browsers implement this by surrounding the text in
quotation marks and a URL for the source of the quotation may be given
using the `<cite>` attribute and as an external link as in the below example.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    When Dave asks HAL to open the pod bay doors, HAL answers:{" "}
    <q cite="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/quotes/qt0396921">
      <a
        title="imdb.com"
        href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/quotes/qt0396921"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
      >
        I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
      </a>
    </q>
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="BlockQuotation" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Block Quotation

For longer quotations a quotation block component should be used with
the `<blockquote>` element which indicates that the enclosed text is
an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation.
A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the `<cite>`
attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using
the `<cite>` element. An external link to the cited source may also be
given if the source is a URL as in the below example.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
      <p>
        "Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they’ll go through
        anything. You read and you’re pierced."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>
      — Aldous Huxley,{" "}
      <cite>
        <a
          title="huxley.net/bnw/four"
          href="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Brave New World
        </a>
      </cite>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</Canvas>

<div id="Code" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Inline Code

Inline code is written inline with other text and is formatted using
the `<code>` element to display its contents styled in a fashion intended
to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. This code
content is displayed using the design system's monospace typeface with a
darker background than other paragraph text.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    The function <code>selectAll()</code> highlights all the text in the input
    field.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="BlockCode" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Code Block

Preformatted text is used to display code within code blocks.
The `<pre>` element is used to represent the preformatted text which
is to be presented exactly as written. The text is rendered using the design
system's monospace typeface and is used wrapped around `<code>` elements to
show it is a code block.

<!-- Note:
`<pre>` element does not work within ### Coded Example
<Canvas> so the example code wraps
-->

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  {/* TODO: Add PrismJS */}
  <pre>
    <code>The is a preformatted code block</code>
  </pre>
</Canvas>

<div id="Sample" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Sample Output

For sample output text, such as the output from a computer program or to represent
the command line, the `<samp>` element is used to enclose the inline text.
Note that to add syntax colors a `<span>` may be used with inline styling applied to
change the text color as required.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <samp>
    {/* TODO: Add PrismJS */}
    $ nikki@DESIGN_SYSTEM ~/GitHub/ally-design-system npm run dev-g <br />$ █
  </samp>
</Canvas>

<div id="Variable" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Variable

To represent the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming
context the `<var>` element should be used, presenting the variable name using
italic and bold styling.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    A simple equation: <var>x</var> = <var>y</var> + 2{" "}
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Sup" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Superscript

Superscript is text rendered on a higher baseline than other inline text
and is diplayed in a smaller font size. The `<sup>` element is used to specify
inline text which is to be displayed as superscript such as for in
mathematical equations.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    The most well known physics equations is: <var>E</var>=<var>m</var>
    <var>c</var>
    <sup>2</sup>
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Sub" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Subscript

Subscript is text rendered on a lower baseline than other inline text
and is also displayed in a smaller font size, the same as for superscript.
The `<sub>` element is used to specify inline text which is to be displayed as
subscript such as for denoting the number of atoms of a given element
within a chemical formula.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    Every developers favourite chemical formula is: C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N
    <sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, otherwise known as <b>caffeine</b>.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="key" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Keyboard Input

To display text which represents a keyboard user input as a key, use the `<kbd>`
element which will render the keyboard input with a keyboard key-like style.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <p>
    To open <b>Task Manager</b> in Windows, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +{" "}
    <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Del</kbd> together and then select <b>Task Manager</b>{" "}
    from your list of options.
  </p>
</Canvas>

<div id="Break" style={{ marginTop: "80px" }}></div>

## Thematic Break

A thematic break is used to convey a change of scene in a story, or a shift of
topic within a section between paragraph-level elements. To render this the
`<hr/>` element should be used. This element didn't used to have a semantic meaning
and instead was used to simply render a horizontal rule (line). If you simply need to show
a horizontal rule, for styling purposes only, an atom component should be
created using a styled `<div>` element instead or within layout styling as appropriate.

### Coded Example

<Canvas style={{ margin: "0" }}>
  <section>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
  </section>
</Canvas>
